stage 1:

The following words in "{}" is from a verilog test problem. Now we plan to write a verilog testbench for the module descriped in {}. Firstly, please summarize the module and give me a description of the testbench writing task so I can use it to design my testbench.
Your description should include "specification", "head module", "input/output ports" and other useful information.
Please attach "example" of the testcase if it is mentioned below:

////////////////////////////////
stage 2:

1. can you give a table including test cases to test a digital hardware module according to the specification below? 
2. please attach a rule of these test cases. the rule can be written in python code. the python codes should use the input/output ports in specifications as parameters.

///////////////////////////////
stage 4:

According to the information below, 
1. please generate a verilog testbench code to test the verilog module in specification. Your code should include all of the testcases. 
2. very important: Your testbench testcases should strongly rely on the python code from stage 2!!!
3. very important: If all the test cases pass, the testbench should display "all test cases passed". If any one of the test cases fails, testbench should not display "all test caess passed". 
4. There should be clear enough messages indicate the reason and details when test does not pass.
5. attention! Your reply should only contain the testbench code. reply template:
